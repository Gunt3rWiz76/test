Business Objective:
	•	Improve efficiency, controls, and cost savings by enhancing SystemX’s usability and content management features.
	•	Align with enterprise branding and accessibility (ADA) compliance requirements to unlock future enhancements.
	•	Enhance the end-user experience to improve content discoverability, clarity, and relevance.
	•	Reduce operational friction for content writers, allowing for better content curation and impact analysis.
	•	Assess and potentially enhance backend code structure to support future AI-driven modeling and automation opportunities.

Project Timeline:
	•	January – December 2026

Business Priority:
	•	High Priority: This initiative is critical to improving efficiency and compliance while addressing usability gaps that impact thousands of users.

Key Enhancements:

For End-Users:
	•	Improved ability to identify and interact with multimedia content.
	•	Enhanced search results to improve content discoverability.
	•	Clear indicators for new and revised content to streamline updates.
	•	Synopsis and intended audience visibility to help users quickly assess relevance.

For Content Writers:
	•	Improved impact analysis when retiring or modifying content.
	•	Built-in acronym check to enforce clarity and consistency.
	•	Enhancements to the content preview process, improving accuracy before publishing.

Technical Enhancements:
	•	Identify and potentially enhance backend code structure to enable future AI-driven modeling, such as automated content tagging, predictive search improvements, and trend analysis.
	•	Ensure scalability and flexibility in the system architecture to support emerging AI capabilities.

Compliance & Technical Considerations:
	•	The XYZ system currently has 375+ ADA compliance issues, requiring resolution before any further enhancements can be made.
	•	Enterprise branding non-compliance is a blocker to ongoing UI/UX improvements.

Risks of Not Investing:
	•	Continued inefficiencies in content discovery and management, increasing operational burden.
	•	User frustration due to poor search results and lack of clear content indicators.
	•	Missed compliance deadlines, preventing future system enhancements and putting the platform at risk.
	•	Higher long-term costs due to delayed fixes and growing technical debt.
	•	Inability to leverage AI-driven efficiencies in the future, potentially falling behind industry standards.
