Backend Considerations

    Data Structure & Storage
        How is content stored and indexed?
        What metadata is associated with each content item?
        How is user profile data structured and stored?

    Search & Retrieval
        What search technology is currently used (e.g., keyword-based, semantic search, vector-based)?
        How are search results ranked and filtered based on user profiles?
        Are there limitations in the current search infrastructure that need to be addressed?

    Content Access & Permissions
        What access controls exist for different user profiles?
        How are permissions enforced when retrieving or suggesting content?
        How should AI-generated recommendations respect these permissions?

    Content Relationships & Modularity
        Are there explicit relationships between different pieces of content (e.g., parent-child relationships, dependencies)?
        How should AI handle modular content conflicts given past challenges?

    Versioning & Updates
        How does the system manage version control for frequently updated content?
        How should AI recommendations handle outdated or unpublished content?

    Performance & Scalability
        What is the expected query volume, and can the infrastructure scale to support AI-driven enhancements?
        How should AI-generated insights be cached or stored for efficiency?

    Integration with Existing Workflow & Systems
        How will AI interact with the existing content approval workflows?
        Should AI be used only for search and recommendations, or also for content generation/summarization?

Front-End Considerations

    User Personalization & Experience
        How should AI personalize search results while maintaining consistency and compliance?
        What UI elements are needed to indicate why a result was suggested?

    Search Behavior & User Input
        Should AI autocomplete or suggest queries based on profile history?
        Will users need the ability to override AI-based filtering?

    Transparency & Explainability

    How will the system explain why certain results are ranked higher or lower?
    Will users have visibility into how their profile affects search results?

    Feedback & Continuous Learning

    Will there be a mechanism for users to provide feedback on AI-generated results?
    How will AI learn from user interactions without compromising compliance?

    Compliance & Auditability

    What regulatory or internal compliance requirements must be met for AI-driven search and recommendations?
    How can AI-generated decisions be logged and audited?

Storage Considerations

    Database Type:
        Is SystemX using a relational database (e.g., SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL) or a NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB, Elasticsearch)?
        Does the system use a hybrid approach, combining structured and unstructured storage?

    Content Format:
        Is content stored as raw text, HTML, JSON, XML, or another format?
        Are metadata and tagging stored separately from the actual content?

    Scalability & Performance:
        How large is the total dataset in terms of storage size?
        Can the current storage solution handle increased AI-driven queries?
        Are there constraints on query response times?

    Content Retrieval Efficiency:
        Are content retrievals optimized for speed, or are there bottlenecks?
        Are certain content types (e.g., high-traffic procedures) cached for faster access?

Indexing Considerations

    Indexing Technology:
        Is the system using a search index like Elasticsearch, Solr, or another full-text search engine?
        Does it rely on simple keyword matching, or is it already using some form of natural language processing (NLP)?

    Index Structure:
        Are different sections of a procedure (e.g., steps, job aids, supplemental materials) indexed separately or together?
        Is metadata (e.g., author, review date, FLU owner) indexed for filtering purposes?
        Are unpublished or archived items indexed, or are they excluded?

    Index Updates:
        How frequently is the search index updated when content is modified or unpublished?
        Is there a delay between content updates and their availability in search?

    Profile-Based Indexing:
        How does indexing account for user profiles? Are separate indexes maintained per profile, or is filtering applied dynamically?
        Can the AI solution leverage the existing profile-based indexing, or will it require re-indexing content differently?
